        <h2>Electrical Engineer</h2>

        <p>
          I recently graduated from Mississippi State University with a Bachelors of Science in 
          Electrical Engineering and Mathematics. I took many classes related to computer networking, 
          signals and systems, feedback control systems, and computer programming. The coding languages 
          I have learned are Python and C++. I have also purused learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript 
          outside of my schooling.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also love creating content and have been working on creating YouTube videos, 
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeKg81gJsaJR9_FLckFuaFQ">ReadingRoz</a> , where I 
          discuss my less technical passions like reading and storytelling.

            During college, I decided to start a passion project to learn some new skills and 
            techniques. I learned how to use Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Photoshop to create and 
            edit videos where I discuss books I love. Through this project, I've learned how to 
            speak confidently and communicate my thoughts.
